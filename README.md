# Ambilight-Clone
First android project at all, made a bit of an ambilight clone, it's not very well written (used to be a bit better organized but made some last minute changes, changed PixelCopy API for ImageReader in an attempt to be able to capture HDMI signals coming in Android TV, unluckily it didn't work.)
BUT, it works and I'm very proud of it as a first personal project.

It tries to make a bitmap out of your Android screen and pushes it to Yeelight's API for Yeelight Lightstrips.
