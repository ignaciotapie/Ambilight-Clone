# Ambilight-Clone
First android project at all, took me about a week, made something of an Ambilight clone for Yeelight lightstrips, it's not very well written (used to be a bit better organized but made some last minute changes, changed PixelCopy API for ImageReader in an attempt to be able to capture HDMI signals coming in Android TV, unluckily it didn't work.)
BUT, it works and I'm very proud of it as a first personal project.

It tries to make a bitmap out of your Android screen and pushes it to Yeelight's API for Yeelight Lightstrips. Unluckily it's not very optimized so, running this natively on an Android TV with 2GB of RAM is a bit much, it auto-closes when the RAM usage is too high.

Good enough for a demo at least!
